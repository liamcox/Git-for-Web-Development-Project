Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
	An inline element takes up just the space it needs and a block element takes up a whole line
    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 
	Its positioned relative to its closest element but other elements can be positioned relative to the window.
    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 
	set the display to inline-block
    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
 P,div,header.  Anchor tag img tag, button
    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the fix for the box model? 
	Theres 4 levels to the box model. Here they are from outer to inner, Margin, Border, Padding, Content. A problem with this model is that you need to do math to figure out the true space an item takes up so to fix that we do box-sizing:border-box. This makes it so an item can never be bigger than its width.
